# IELTS-Dictation-App

### This app is for IELTS vocabulary dictation tailored to K-pop preferences.
The project extracts words and their Chinese translation from pdf files and saves them into separate CSV files.

The app, implemented through flask, allows users to practice vocabulary from two different sources: Basic and Advanced. Users can select a specific range of vocabulary items by code for dictation practice. For each selected word, the Chinese translation will be displayed, and users will be prompted to input the corresponding English word. Upon submission, the app will show the user's input, the correct word, and the Chinese translation, helping users track their progress.
