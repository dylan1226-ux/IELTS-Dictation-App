# IELTS-Dictation-App

## This is an APP for IELTS vocabulary dictation.
The app allows users to practice vocabulary from two different sources: Basic and Advanced. Users can select a specific range of vocabulary items by code for dictation practice. For each selected word, the Chinese translation will be displayed, and users will be prompted to input the corresponding English word. Upon submission, the app will show the user's input, the correct word, and the Chinese translation, helping users track their progress.
